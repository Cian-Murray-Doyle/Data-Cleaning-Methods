# Data-Cleaning-Methods
Introduction to project

Fetch Cuisine is a homemade meal kit delivery company. Their packages include a wide range of ingredients from multiple suppliers. Each time an order is made from the suppliers, the nutritional information dataset needs to be updated.

Fetch Cuisine is experiencing a huge influx of new customers thanks to a successful social media campaign. This means that Fetch has to place many more orders with their suppliers. However, consolidating all this data into a clean and uniform dataset is taking far too much time. The current approach of manually cleaning this data is also prone to error. Some customers recently complained about receiving orders with the wrong nutrients. 

Youâ€™ve been hired by Fetch to rapidly solve this problem so that they can win back, retain and grow trust in their optimally configured meals.
